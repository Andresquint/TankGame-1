## About:

This was my first game project for my CSC 613 at SFSU. It was coded in Java, using OOP.

How to play the game:

* Tank Wars is a two player game with two tanks.
* The goal is to distroy the other tank by firing bullets at the other player.
* Each player has health that will deplete after each bullet hit. The health bar is at the bottom of each player's screen. After 5 hits, the player's health will run out and they will lose one life. When a player has only one more hit to go thier rate of fire will double.
* Each player has 2 extra lives, once all 3 lives are gone the game is over and the other player wins.
* There are 2 health packs that a player can collect in the middle of the battlefield that will replenish the player's health back to full health. The health packs will not reappear.
* There are 2 kinds of blocks in the game world. Ones that can be broken are darker in color and the ones that can't be broken are lighter in color.
* Player one's screen is on the left and Player two's screen is on the right.

* Player 1 controls:

W: moves forward
S: moves backwards
A: rotates the tank counter clockwise
D: rotates the tank clockwise
Spacebar: fires the bullets

* Player 2 controls:

Up arrow: moves forward
Down arrow: moves backwards
Left arrow: rotates the tank counter clockwise
